## AF-Reasoning-Eval

The AF-Reasoning-Eval benchmark is included in ```AF_Reasoning_Eval/```. 

- The ```AQA``` subset is derived from [Clotho-AQA](https://zenodo.org/records/6473207), and our filenames point to Clotho-AQA filenames. Note that the Clotho-AQA audio files follow their original license. 
- The ```Classification``` subset is derived from [FSD50K](https://zenodo.org/records/4060432), and our filenames point to FSD50K filenames. Note that the FSD50K audio files follow their original license. 
- Our metadata are released under ```CC-BY 4.0```.

## AF-CoT-Train

The ```AF-CoT-Train``` generation pipelines are included in ```AF_CoT_Train/```. It is recommended to use ```alg_6_AQA_subquestions.py``` to generate reasoning chains for AQA samples and ```alg_8_Classification_MCQ.py``` to generate reasoning chains for classification samples.

The dataset is released in [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/AF-Think/tree/main/afcot).

## Inference code
The instruction to run inference of the CoT model is [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/audio-flamingo/tree/audio_flamingo_2/inference_HF_pretrained#steps-of-inference-of-the-cot-model).

I will first analyze the sound's characteristics (e.g., eerie, suspenseful, chaotic) and then match them to the typical soundscapes of each genre (e.g., horror's eerie tones, action's intense rhythms, comedy's lightheartedness, romance's emotional tones). &lt;/summary&gt;

        </span>
        <span style="color: #8C2121;">
        <br> &lt;reasoning&gt; The bass guitar produces low-frequency sounds, typically ranging from the lowest a1 note (22 hz) to the highest e4 note (659 hz), contributing a rich, deep tone to the overall sound of a band or ensemble. The sound does not fit with the label 'bass guitar' as the audio features a guitar being played, not a bass guitar.<br> The electric guitar produces a sound that is characterized by its bright, clear, and resonant tone, which can be further shaped and modified by various electronic effects and amplification. The sound fits with the label 'electric guitar' as it is a musical instrument that produces sound through electric amplification.<br> Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibration of strings, amplified by the guitar's body, resulting in a warm, resonant tone that is often described as natural and clear. The sound fits with the label 'acoustic guitar' as it is a musical instrument that produces sound through the vibration of its strings, which can be played with a pick or fingers.<br> Boiling produces a continuous, high-pitched hissing sound as water vapor bubbles rapidly rise to the surface. The sound does not fit with the label 'boiling'. &lt;/reasoning&gt;

        <br> &lt;summary&gt; The question asks to identify the competition venue based on audio cues. I will first analyze the specific sounds or cues present in the audio, then determine which venue (tennis, badminton, table tennis, table soccer) is most associated with those sounds, and finally check for any conflicting sounds that might indicate a different venue. &lt;/summary&gt;

        <span style="color: #8C2121;">
        <br> &lt;reasoning&gt; The audio contains distinct sounds of a ball bouncing and people talking. Table tennis is uniquely characterized by the distinct sound of a ball hitting a table and the rhythmic bounce, which aligns with the described audio cues. While table soccer may involve similar sounds, the specific bounce and impact noises are more characteristic of table tennis. No conflicting sounds are present to suggest alternative venues. &lt;/reasoning&gt;
